# Coursework Archive

This repository contains selected assignments, projects, and notes from graduate-level courses I have completed as part of my academic journey at North Carolina State University. The content reflects my interest in intelligent systems, data analytics, and energy sustainability.

## Course List

### 1. **ARC 523 – Parametric Design and Optimization (Fall 2023)**
This course deals with the fundamentals of building sciences in terms of energy systems. Energy modeling and simulation technologies are used to predict and analyze the energy performance of buildings. The students calculate the energy consumption of heating, cooling, lighting, and equipment by hand to understand the energy & thermal behavior of buildings and then compare and analyze them with those calculated by energy modeling and simulation programs.

### 2. **ECE 542 – Neural Networks (Spring 2024)**
Techniques for the design of neural networks for machine learning. An introduction to deep learning. Emphasis on theoretical and practical aspects including implementations using state-of-the-art software libraries. Requirement: Programming experience (an object-oriented language such as Python), linear algebra (MA 405 or equivalent), and basic probability and statistics.

### 3. **ECE 592 – Data Analytics for Power Engineering (Fall 2024)**
Introduction to data science and Python programming. Exploratory data analysis in power systems. Classical machine learning methods. Deep learning with PyTorch. Power system optimization with Gurobi. Big data applications in power systems.

### 4. **ECE 592 – Physics Modeling with Neural Networks (Fall 2024)**
This course will focus on learning about state-of-the-art techniques for physical modeling using neural networks. It will be a mixture of lectures, paper discussions and evaluations of state-of-the-art programming libraries.

### 5. **ISE 589 – Risk, Resilience, and Sustainability (Fall 2024)**
This course provides an introduction to the concepts of sustainability and risk analysis. The beginning of this course will cover fundamentals of sustainability as well as basic risk and re silience theory including: IPAT; the Kaya Identity; and risk as a triplet of scenarios, uncertainty, and consequences. 

### 6. **ECE 592 – Utility-Scale Solar PV Systems (Spring 2025)**
Course focuses on designing and analyzing a Utility Scale PV Solar System in a comprehensive way. Topics include Electrical Design, Environmental Constraints, Civil and Structural Design, Meteorological Data Evaluation, Drafting PV Layouts, Energy Output Assessment, Optimization of System Design, Investment and Valuation, Financing Option. Course also explores Integration of BESS, Green Hydrogen with the PV Project. Course will have guest lecturers from experts in the solar industry.

### 7. **ST 554 – Analysis of Big Data (Spring 2025)**
Course discusses current big data management practices and software along with statistical paradigms important for big data and predictive analytics. Literate programming and good programming practices are covered.
